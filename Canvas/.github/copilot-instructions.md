- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
  <!-- I will create a static HTML/CSS/JS project to replicate the chart. I'll use Chart.js CDN for easier setup than the webpack bundle, but I'll try to reverse engineer the config. -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
  <!-- Create index.html, style.css, app.js -->

- [x] Extract Chart Configuration
  <!-- Analyze the provided ChartJs.js content to find colors, fonts, grid configurations for "DoubleLineChart". -->

- [x] Implement Index.html
  <!-- Use the provided HTML snippet. -->

- [x] Implement Styles
  <!-- Create CSS for .b-chart and children. I'll use placeholders if I can't read app.css, but I'll try to make it look like the provided HTML attributes suggest (dimensions etc). -->

- [x] Implement Chart Logic
  <!-- Initialize Chart.js instances for the two canvases. Feed them mock data that looks like the screenshot. -->

- [x] Launch
